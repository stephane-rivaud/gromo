    DAG merge statistics are filled from a mean-reduced loss

    which shrinks ``M`` and ``dW*`` by about one batch while ``S`` is
    unchanged. Multiplying by the batch size undoes that division once.

    Do not also switch those callers to ``reduction="sum"``: the two
    corrections would scale ``M`` by the batch size a second time.
    ``MSELoss(reduction="mean")`` divides by every output element, not only
    the batch, and this factor does not undo that.

class TensorStatistic:
    """
    Class to store a tensor statistic and update it with a given function.
    A tensor statistic is a tensor that is an average of a given tensor over
    multiple samples. It is typically computed by batch.

    When computing the new source data, the tensor statistic should be
    informed that it is not updated. Then the update function should be called
    to update the tensor statistic.

    Example:
        We want to compute the average of a set of tensors of shape (2, 3) in data
        loader `data_loader`. We can use the following code:

            ```python
            tensor_statistic = TensorStatistic(
                shape=(2, 3),
                update_function=lambda data: (data.sum(dim=0), data.size(0)),
                name="Average",
            )
            for data_batch in data_loader:
                tensor_statistic.updated = False
                tensor_statistic.update(data_batch)

            print(tensor_statistic())

class TensorStatiticWithEstimationError(TensorStatistic):

    Extends TensorStatistic with estimated quadratic error.

    Extends TensorStatistic to compute an estimation of the quadratic error of the current
    estimate to the true expectation. This is done by computing the trace of the
    covariance matrix of the random variable averaged on a batch. The trace is computed
    incrementally using a stopping criterion based on a relative precision.

    Note that the precision of the trace computation can be controlled by the user, and
    the true precision of the trace
    will not be guaranteed to be below this value, indeed if trace_precision is set to
    eps, the expected relative precision
    on the trace computation will be of order sqrt(eps).

        We want to compute the average of a set of tensors of shape (2, 3) in data
        loader `data_loader`. We can use the following code:
