Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds support for selecting GroupNorm as the normalization layer in the ResNet container, alongside the existing BatchNorm option (:gh:`233` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_).
- Adds variance-transfer (VT) weight rescaling and (V,V)/(Z,-Z) neuron pairing to the growing-module extension workflow (:gh:`237` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Adds configurability to the ResNet container to allow using BatchNorm2d or disabling normalization entirely (:gh:`228` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Add ``uv`` files, use ``uv sync --extra dev --extra test --extra doc`` to install the package with all dependencies (:gh:`226` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Use ``ruff`` for formatting (:gh:`227` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Change how size-dependent post_layer_function modules handle extended activities in the growing module framework (:gh:`224` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Compute first order improvement for `GrowingDAG` (:gh:`210` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Implement `GrowingLayerNorm` and `GrowingGroupNorm` (:gh:`211` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Add a new `evaluate_model`,  `gradient_descent` and `compute_statistics` functions (:gh:`203` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Reduce `ruff check` scope and make it blocking in CI/CD (:gh:`207` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Allow reconstruction of the computational graph of GrowingDAG to reload state_dict (:gh:`209` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Refactor ``compute_optimal_updates`` in ``GrowingModule`` and ``GrowingBlock`` to accept primitive boolean options (``compute_delta``, ``use_covariance``, ``alpha_zero``, ``use_projection``). This enables composable configurations for neuron initialization methods. Threshold defaults are intentionally unified to ``numerical_threshold=1e-6`` and ``statistical_threshold=1e-3`` across the affected growth APIs: ``1e-6`` flags numerical-conditioning issues close to float32 precision and ``1e-3`` defines the acceptable statistical noise level for singular-value filtering. For GradMax behavior, use ``compute_delta=False, use_covariance=False, alpha_zero=True, use_projection=False`` (:gh:`193` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Introduces a new GrowingModel class to have a fixed output size model. (:gh:`206` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Improve flexibility in `growing_block` and `resnet` to allow creating more complex structures and to support more use cases (:gh:`194` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Change the behavior for negative scaling factor. Now use a positive scaling factor for the parameter update independently of the sign of the scaling factor. (:gh:`195` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Fix a convergence problem in `sqrt_inverse_matrix_semi_positive` (:gh:`192` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Added documentation linting in CI/CD and reduced warnings in tests (:gh:`158` by `Stella Douka`_)
- New tutorial for `GrowingContainer` (:gh:`188` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)

- Add `in_neurons` property and `target_in_neurons` parameter to `GrowingModule`, `LinearGrowingModule`, and `Conv2dGrowingModule` for tracking neuron counts during growth. Add `missing_neurons`, `number_of_neurons_to_add`, and `complete_growth` methods to simplify multi-step growth processes (:gh:`187` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Add new normalization methods (:gh:`185` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Update `output_volume` in `Conv2dMergeGrowingModule` based on post_merge_function and reshaping (:gh:`177` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Implement lazy loading datasets that read directly from the disk (:gh:`169` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Modify `in_channels` and `out_channels` as properties in `Conv2dGrowingModule` (:gh:`174` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Introduce a `SequentialGrowingContainer` structure specialized for container with sequential layers.  Introduce a `ResNetBasicBlock` class to create resnet 18/34 like structure with growable blocks and the possibility of adding blocks. (:gh:`168` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Allow to create layer extension with different simple initialization (different random and zero). (:gh:`165` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Add `TensorStatisticWithEstimationError` and corresponding class `TestTensorStatisticWithEstimationError`. It computes an estimation of the quadratic error done when estimating the given tensor statistic. Modify `TensorStatistic` so that there is no need to call init (:gh:`149` by `Félix Houdouin`_).
- Add a method `normalize_optimal_updates` in `GrowingModule` to normalize the optimal weight updates before applying them (:gh:`164` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)

- Minor improvements of `GrowingContainer` (:gh:`161` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Add `in_features` and `out_features` properties to `GrowingModule` and `LinearGrowingModule` (:gh:`160` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Add support for convolutional DAGs in `GrowingDAG` and `GrowingGraphNetwork` (:gh:`148` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Handle previous and next layers when deleting `GrowingModule` and `MergeGrowingModule` objects (:gh:`148` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Add `weights_statistics` method to `GrowingModule` and `GrowingContainer` to retrieve statistics of weights in all growing layers. (:gh:`152` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Add `ruff` linter to pre-commit hooks and to the CI (:gh:`151` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)
- Add `GrowingBlock` to mimic a ResNet 18/34 block. (:gh:`106` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_)

- Estimate dependencies between activities for faster expansion (:gh:`100` by `Stella Douka`_)
- Makes flattening of input optional in GrowingMLP. Default value is True for backward compatibility (:gh:`108` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_).
- Add the option to handle post layer function that need to grow like BatchNorm (:gh:`105` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_).
- Add robust `compute_optimal_delta` function to `gromo.utils.tools` with comprehensive dtype handling, automatic LinAlgError fallback to pseudo-inverse, float64 retry mechanism for negative decrease scenarios, and extensive test suite achieving 95% coverage. Function computes optimal weight updates for layer expansion using mathematical formula dW* = M S⁻¹ with full backward compatibility (:gh:`114` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Refactor `GrowingModule` to centralize `tensor_s_growth` handling (:gh:`109` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Add `use_projected_gradient` parameter to growing modules to control whether to use projected gradient (`tensor_n`) or raw tensor (`tensor_m_prev`) for computing new neurons. This provides more flexibility in the optimization strategy and improves test coverage for critical code paths (:gh:`104` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_).
- Fix statistics normalization in `LinearGrowingModule` (:gh:`110` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_)
- Implement systematic test coverage improvement initiative achieving 92% → 95% overall coverage through 4-phase strategic enhancement targeting critical modules: utils.py (80% → 96%), tools.py (78% → 98%), and growing_module.py (92% → 94%). Added 27 comprehensive test methods covering multi-device compatibility, error handling paths, mathematical algorithm edge cases, and abstract class testing via concrete implementations (:gh:`113` by `Stéphane Rivaud`_).

- Code factorization of methods `compute_optimal_added_parameters` and `compute_optimal_delta` that are now abstracted in the `GrowingModule` class. (:gh:`87` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_).
- Stops automatically computing parameter update in `Conv2dGrowingModule.compute_optimal_added_parameters`to be consistent with `LinearGrowingModule.compute_optimal_added_parameters` (:gh:`87` by `Théo Rudkiewicz`_) .

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``compute_optimal_updates()`` now exposes primitive boolean controls (``compute_delta``, ``use_covariance``, ``alpha_zero``, ``use_projection``) and growth-related defaults are intentionally unified to ``numerical_threshold=1e-6`` and ``statistical_threshold=1e-3`` for consistency across modules.
