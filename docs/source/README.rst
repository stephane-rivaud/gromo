GroMo
-----

Gromo is a collaborative effort for designing efficient and growable networks
for machine learning. It is a Python package that provides a set of tools for
pytorch users to train neural networks, that grow in size and complexity as
they learn. The package is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing users
to easily design and train their own networks.

The package is built on top of `torch.nn.Module`, examples shows how to use
the package to train a simple neural network, and how to grow the network as
it learns. The theoretical and algorithmic details of Gromo are described in
the [TMLR24]_.

The package is still in development, if you would like to contribute, please
